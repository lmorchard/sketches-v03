# lmorchard's sketches-v03

For years, I've tinkered with game development on the web. But, I haven't finished (m)any games. So, I decided to just focus more on finishing little interesting sketches of graphics and sound.

For this iteration, I'm thinking about moving toward the sketches being usable as web components. That way, I can share them in blog posts and do other fun things hopefully.

I'm also trying to avoid using a build system beyond bare minimum bundling, if at all possible.
